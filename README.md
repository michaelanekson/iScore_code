# I Score Implementation

This repository contains code for the **I Score**, inspired by the paper  
*"Why Significant Variables Arenâ€™t Automatically Good Predictors"* by Adeline Lo *et al.*

The code is organized into a reusable function for ease of use.  
Feel free to modify it as needed. Contributions or suggestions for turning this into a full **R/Python package** are welcome.
